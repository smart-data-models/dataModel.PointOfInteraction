# dataModel.PointOfInteraction
As an alternative or extension to traditional interactive points (shopping malls, museums, airports, etc.), a Smart Point of Interaction use technologies such as Bluetooth Low Energy or Wi-Fi to bring new interactions to user's devices (smartphones, wearables, etc.).

The following entity types are available:
- [SmartPointOfInteraction](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.PointOfInteraction/blob/master/SmartPointOfInteraction/README.md). A smart point of interaction is composed mainly by two entities: "Smart Point of Interaction": defines an
interactive point which provides information, entertainment or co-creation tools to citizens.
Optionally it can reference a related smart city asset with enriched interaction provided by this technology.
"Smart Spot": a set of resources related to a physical device and the technology to provide a Smart Point of Interaction.


- [SmartSpot](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.PointOfInteraction/blob/master/SmartSpot/README.md). Smart Spots are devices which provide the technology which allows users to get
access to smart points of interaction so that they can obtain extra information
(infotainment, etc.), provide suggestions (suggestions mailbox, etc.) or
generate new content (co-creation, etc.). The data model contains resources to
configure the interaction service such as the broadcasted URL (typically
shortened), the period between broadcasts, the availability of the service,
transmission power depending on the area to be covered, etc.
