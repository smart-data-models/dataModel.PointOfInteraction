  A Smart Point of Interaction defines a place with technology to interact with users, for example, through Beacon technology from Apple, Eddystone/Physical-Web from Google or other proximity-based interfaces. Since the interactive area could be composed by more than one device providing the technology, this model encompasses a group of SmartSpot devices. The data model includes information regarding the area/surface covered by the technology (i.e., the area covered by Bluetooth Low Energy-based Beacon), a way to specify the functionality intervals (i.e. when interactive points are available) and a link to a multimedia resource intended to user interaction (i.e. Web Apps, etc.). Additionally, the data model may reference to another NGSI entity such as a Parking, a Point of Interest (POI), etc. with enriched interaction provided by this Smart Point of Interaction.
